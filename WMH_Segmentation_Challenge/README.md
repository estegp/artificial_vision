# WMH Segmentation Challenge 

This challenge consists of the segmentation of white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin on brain MR images.

Work done:

- Reader that reads the nifti files with the MR images

Work in progress:

- Basic CNN neural network used to segmentate the lesions from the brain. 

Work to be done:

- Implementation of a neural network with UNET architecture
- Implementation of a neural network with Deepmedic architecture
- Perfomance study
- Improvement of the implementation/desing of the previous neural networks
