# WMH Segmentation Challenge 

This challenge consist on the segmentation of white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin on brain MR images.

Work done:

- Read the nifti files that contain the MR images

Work in progress:

- Basic CNN neural network use to segmentate the lessions from the brain matter. 

Work to be done:

- Implementation of a neural network with UNET architecture
- Implementation of a neural network with Deepmedic architecture
- Perfomance study
- Improve of the implementation/desing of the neural networks implemented
